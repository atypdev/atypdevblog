*In our modern society, social deviance has become a subject of great interest and concern. This project aims to explore the intricate relationship between social deviance and criminal behaviors, shedding light on the factors that contribute to deviant actions and their potential consequences. By delving into the underlying causes and examining real-world examples, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics at play and their implications for our communities.*

### Functional Analysis and Neighborhoods

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Provide a Functional Analysis approach to understanding the significance of neighborhoods.
- Manifest function
- Latent functions
- What are at least 3 characteristics of a well functioning neighborhood.
- Provide evidence from a source in which you explain each of the characteristics.
</details>

The significance of neighborhoods lie in their ability to bring together, form relationships between and otherwise create tight-knit communities of individuals whom can rely on each other, form common interests and advocate for them in city councils or neighborhood councils. 

The point of a neighborhood is to shorten the gap between individuals, as to provide a standardized and easily fundable home among others, at the lowest cost possible. This is all in the pursuit of the common interest of residents.

Possible hidden functions of a neighborhood is the bonds that form of entire comminities and not just neighboors. The ties made between very distinct individuals can assist in many facets, much further than on the surface. This can include things like funding for non-goverment projects on the personal scale.

|Characteristics of a Well Functioning Neighborhood|
|--|
| - **Cleanliness of roads, sidewalks and housing:** Living in a clean environment **makes life healthier, less stressful, and more pleasant**. It can improve the self-image of residents and of the neighborhood as a whole.

| - **Public amenities such as parks or community centers:** Neighborhoods that host community events like block parties and farmers’ markets tend to be closer. [Source](https://www.safewise.com/blog/factors-to-consider-when-determining-the-safety-of-your-neighborhood/) |
| - **Low crime rates:** Neighborhoods play an important role in home safety and personal happiness. If you live in a safe community, you’re more likely to enjoy spending time outside gardening or watching your kids play.

#### A Contrast Between two Atlanta Neighborhoods

| Observations: High Crime Neighborhood | Observations: Low Crime Neighborhood |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Streets and housing looks run down, smaller homes with families sitting outside. | Large community centers with expensive signage |
| Music being played out loud | Well kept streets, greenery |
| Threatened of being demolished | Median income of 60k |
| Flooding and supposed water main break -> low maintenance standards, safety is not the cities main concern | Expensive cars and much larger houses |
| Worst issue: Murders | Safety seems to be a concern of those in charge |
| Fights among themselves and with other groups | Maintenance is commonplace as the streets, homes and amenities are in good shape; clean and structurally sound |

| Possible Explanations: High Crime Neighborhood | Possible Explanations: Low Crime Neighborhood |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| With lesser amenities, it can be assumed that with less to do crime could be a result of boredom. Additionally, criminal activity in the pursuit of monetary gain. | With a large amount of amenities there’s not only more to do, but also a desire to keep said amenities clean. |
| The visible criminal activity may perpetuate the idea that crime is okay in this area. | Security and relative safety (with a few exceptions) creates a possible feeling of guilt among members of the community. |
| Hostility due to environmental and social pressures, such as the threats of buildings being demolished. | Comfort and neighborly kindness may be exhibited among each other. |

  

### A Family of Criminals
<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Agents of socialization: in what ways do specific agents socialize people to make decisions to commit crime?
- How might labeling theory play a role in this specific crime?
- Control/Social Disorganization Theory:
	- How does the lack of certain social bonds drive this behavior?
- Strain Theory:
	- How can this theory explain why the family decided to engage in this crime?

</details>

Specific agents of socialization contribute to our understanding of this family by providing explanations for the family unit, its dynamic, and how pride can affect the treatment of one's children. 

Labels, especially that of criminal, bad father and bank robbers may very well affect each in this family for the rest of their lives. Having not been caught initially and trying to become secretive "Bank Robbers" once more, it can be argued that the application of said title could've skewed the father and his children's feelings towards the possible outcomes of doing it twice. They felt invincible, superseding most. 

A lack of the bond between the mother, father and children has already been attributed to the crime's cause, although I'd argue that the additional lack of respect for the children from the father may have player a major role in the manipulation used to commit said crime.

The main stressor/strain in this example is finances. This is what initially drove them to commit this crime, and directly correlates to why they decided to commit it again after losing the first one's spoils. 

### World’s Biggest Financial Fraud

<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Include the Strain Theory Chart on your slide.
- Using the information in the reading and the chart, explain how this theory can be used to explain why this crime occurred.

</details>

***1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal***
- Billions of Dollars was stolen from Malaysia.
- Funding that was for the public essentially stolen for 1Malaysia's CEO
- Najib Razak (serving prime minister) was arrested.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I-dVFffpNLNXLo2m_7HdSCqw76IRxZW0ZCt8z0XUgeSTzT60vWCfKHM-TPCo8-Ezpua4uKaYSWAQJR1ojbUKyz1bZv2eIUF0DxKcZa04ggl3unhpLD6uCKdIzRb5OJE1SAD4L7WDbIuNgjJZhhi-irF23g=s2048)

This chart is how Robert K. Merton explains the existence of deviancy and the response from society. This topological reasoning can be applied to the 1MDB scandal as follows...

1. **Conformity:** Individuals played a larger part in the scandal by following pre-established social norms, except for that of higher-ranked officials whom were deviant by breaking these norms, including those concerning legality.
2. **Innovation:** Those involved can be assumed to have sought out possibly dangerous or deviant ways to achieve a social status; that of monetary wealth. This is innovation due to its circumvention of legality through business.
3. **Ritualism:** Many involved hadn't followed ritualism, but instead followed suit in ambition of personal gain. 
4. **Retreatism:** Those responsible for the prosecution can be said to have taken retaliatory actions, because normal government checks and balances were ignored in favor for personal gains. 
5. **Rebellion:** The rebellion can be seen in the media outlets covering the scandal, as they were going against the grain of not just 1MDB themselves, but possibly the entire Malaysian governing body.  

### Devious Licks TikTok Challenge

 
<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Which agent of socialization is involved?
- Apply Control/Social Disorganization Theory to explain this behavior
- Specifically apply Hirschi’s idea of the 4 Social Bonds!

</details>

  **Palmer High School – Destruction of Bathrooms

Socialization is the process of learning the characteristics of the group to which a person belongs, the Agents are the groups, individuals and societies that determine who taught this person where they belong. The agent of socialization in effect is that of school peers.  

Hirschi's social bond theory could be applied in this context as...
1. **Attachment:** A lack of attachment could be a contributor to the destruction, as the social isolation could very well influence acts of destruction out of frustration.
2. **Commitment:** Students may not be committed to their academic success and therefore may participate in potentially harmful behaviors despite the effects it may have on the individuals' reputation.
3. **Involvement:** Students who are involved outside of school such as clubs or extracurricular activities may prevent deviance due to a better sense of purpose being discovered.
4. **Belief:** Students may not have a strong sense of respect for the student body or the faculty, where they will not adhere to rules set for the safety of their peers. 

-   Perpetuated by social medias such a TikTok, students were encouraged to act out by their peers.
-   Very expensive:
    -   Time and money – bathrooms arent usable, so students have to go further away
-   Characterized as "Acting Out" by staff, which is a way for them to label these crimes (humans love having reasons for things). 
-   DEVIOUS  LICKS

#### Devious Licks Solution

<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Using the theories from sociology, explain why the school’s response is not going to be an effective long-term solution.
- You need to use both Control Theory and Strain Theory in your response.
- Use either Control Theory or Strain Theory to present a better solution for handling criminally deviant behaviors in the school.
</details>

The school's response to Devious Licks will not be effective as a long-term solution, as the influences are much outside the school's control. It could be said that the prevention of students to use the bathroom is a violation of privacy, and legislature would be sure to follow if the trend of bathroom surveillance continues. A possible understanding of Devious Licks is through using strain theory, which says that the lack of resources, social stimulants or educational opportunities may contribute heavily to the deviancy.

### Fraternity and Sorority Behavior

<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Choose one theory to apply to this behavior.
- Thoroughly explain why this behavior occurs in light of the insights provided by this theory.

</details>

**Hazing:**
  
- Drinking alcohol is a primarily social behavior, which most certainly encouraged the brotherhood to continue forcing the new member to drink.
- There seems to be a set precedence that violence, in the form of hazing, is appropriate among fellow college students.

This can be explained best by Conflict Theory, especially that of competition for a status and the desire to "fit in". Hazing is characterized by its establishment of trust and loyalty among peers, creating a bond between members through tradition. It is a good device for the members in power to use when they want to maintain control over those selected for membership, which may provide members with a sense of belonging after being hazed. 

Additionally, by subjecting new members to possibly harmful and humiliating actions, humor could be derived and power could remain in balance in favor for leadership.

### My Initial Thoughts on Gang Membership

  

<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Why are gangs considered deviant?
- Why do gangs exist and why do they engage in the behaviors that they do?
</details>

  **Gangs:**

- Their status as a criminal organization of some capacity, there’s often a worry of being victimized by these seemingly dangerous groups for no reason.
- The label of “Gang Members” is oftentimes misleading, setting up an expectation that’s unrealistic, but has some realism to it. The only reason this label exists is because of the crimes they commit in a organized manner, which most certainly leads to more dangerous crimes.
- Gangs or other groups that are focused on committing crimes can be primarily focused on not just monetary gain among the members, but also for protection of the members.

  

### Gangs of North America

| Observations: Biker Gang | Observations: Mexican Drug Gang |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Routine meetup turns into a gun battle | - Series of recent violent episodes? This seems to be an ongoing issue. |
| - 100s of bikers | - Visiting Mexico is claimed to be safe. There is incentive from media to say this due to tourism. |
| - 170 arrests | - Concentrations changing, and economics are dependent. |
| - Outlaw biker groups are a serious domestic terror problem |
| - Ex-Gang member lying |

### Theories and Gangs

  

<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- Based on the insights of the following theories, make some inferences about why people might join gangs. You need to include relevant connections to:
	- Labeling Theory
	- Control/Social Disorganization Theory
	-Strain Theory

</details>

  

### Gangs of Chicago

  

<details>

<summary>Instructions</summary>

- How does social disorganization/control theory explain why people choose to join gangs and engage in criminal behavior?

</details>

  **Chicago Gangs:**

- Showing that the youth joining gangs have little alternatives for social and community opportunities.
- People who join gangs have less morals than those who do become involved.
- The solutions never fully worked, there seems to be no solution. Helping gang members to find work / activities outside of gangs works better than legal action.
- Children can’t even go outside to play, because of the violence.

  

| Observations: |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A little boy is worried that he’ll be shot, because his grandma was shot for simply standing outside. Ralph, experiencing very palpable fear, stays inside. |
| **Honor** for one another |
| Day and night, there are gang patrols |
| Even the mother of a dangerous gang member recognize this |
| Most people want to work, to do something they’re good at |
  
- Hope among the community for resolution.

#### Functional Analysis of Policing

  

|| Why? |
|:--:|--|
| Manifest Functions | The intention of the policing is to provide a sense of security, unity and physical safety among a community. This can manifest as moderation or a physical police force. |
|Latent Functions|Protections from possible harm, including that of internal affairs, with an increased emphasis on public safety in the both physical and psychological realms. This leads to a decrease in crime and an increase of overall quality of life in a community.|
|Latent Dysfunctions|Greatly increased fear among members of the community, especially with the increase of military tactics, appearance and functionality of most police forces. |

</details>

  

>  _Video Used: [Vox's Why America's police look like soldiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOAOVbyfjA0)_

  

Police are an important part of keeping a community safe, although, this presents an issue regarding the abilities and scope of the police force.
  
- The forces at some _peaceful_ protests include what seems to be soldiers, when in fact they are police.

- History of the militarization of the police...

- No-knock warrants increased from the 80s to 90s, alongside other SWAT operations. Mostly drug-related.

- SWAT emulates military operations.

- On several occasions people have become injured or died due to an incorrect address.

-  **1980s**: Reagan told the military to work with the police on drug operations by supplying them with training and equipment.

-  **1990s**: National Defense Authorization Act, and subsequently the 1033 Program passed which game M16s, grenade launchers and various heavy vehicles.

-  **1997**: Police robbery in Northern Hollywood. This marked the moment when police departments across not just LA, but all over the US, started requesting military-grade equipment.

-  **2010s**: Marac was withdrawn by the military, which led to massive growth in the amount of "leftovers" for police forces to utilize.

-  **2015**: The 1033 program became nation news, and records were finally kept as to the distribution of this equipment. A police officer in MI shot and killed an unarmed Black teenager, which resulted in protests which were met with a military-grade response. Sniper rifles and the like were deployed.

- President Obama removed the 1033.

-  **2017**: It became part of the identity/mentality, a hostile one, among police that made them more violent. The public is said to perceive the officers as scary and the officers don't care.

  

>  _Any course of action taken by an individual that needs special consideration should do a cost/benefit analysis. This is especially important for laws and programs, such as the 1033._

|---|---|
| - The destruction of and/or desensitization to a distinct lack of **privacy**.  | - Saving people who've gone missing / have suggested/taken action to endanger or otherwise harm oneself or others.

**Impact:**
- There is a very slow, yet palpable impact on the common citizen. Oftentimes we value our comfort and illusion of safety over our rights to privacy. There has been a shift from using these tools in moderation, as decided by the citizen, to excessively, as decided by a central body. The inherent bias has most certainly changed how we view ourselves, from private citizens to products of surveillance.

## In Conclusion...
### How should communities handle criminally deviant behavior?
- **Thoroughly explain your vision for how a community should handle the issue of crime (high crime or low crime community):**
	- Steps must be taken for not just preventative measures, but also to prepare the youth, officers, future and current government officials, the common citizen and every last person of every last group for **change**. Thus is the nature of everything. Expect the unexpected, and make preparations to accommodate for the future, less the present or the past. Forward thinking individuals drive progress, especially those willing to take elements from the present and past, (as to prevent history to repeat). It is only through people such as these that we can ensure safety in communities. Crime is amorphous, always evolving and will always be one step behind the law. Through this I argue that planning for the future, creating legislature that fits the interests of citizens and officials and developing strategies to handle crimes in smaller communities is paramount. 
- **Make sure to mention any relevant theories which fit with your viewpoint:**
	- The primary theory this viewpoint focuses on is Social Strain. Whether its financial troubles, socially isolated individuals or disruptions to otherwise standard accommodations to everyday life, an effort must be made to level the playing field, and improve the quality of life for those of lesser opportunities.

## Definitions / Vocabulary

Social Norms:

: Unwritten rules that guide behavior in societies.

: These norms can be enforced either intrinsically -- with the conformity benefiting those in the group -- or indirectly through the use of body language, tone of voice and more direct but still non-explicit forms of communication such as laughter or making fun of the deviant.

---

Deviant Behavior:

: Any action that goes against **social norms** or expectations, which can be either formal or informal.

: They can be **informal** (ex. taboos and public behavior) or **formal** (ex. laws and regulations). Regardless on whether the deviation is formal or informal, there are usually consequences.

---

Charles Horton Cooley's The Looking Glass Self:

: Our perception of ourselves as influenced by social factors.

: This can include our upbringing, parents, other's reactions and especially social settings with explicit rules such as a religious group. This concept is the idea that individuals base their sense of self on how they believe others perceive them.

---

Conflict:

: All social relations reveal inequalities in the distribution of valuable resources. There is an inequality between the large group (meta-group) and a smaller group. Marxism, on which conflict theory is based, is over the economic side of distribution. Human rights are another category that conflict theory covers, as an abstract idea.

: Those with resources want to keep them (and refuses to share them) and those without want to have them (who will sometimes share them).
Those with resources want to keep them (and refuses to share them) and those without want to have them (who will sometimes share them).

	-   Could be anything from Housing to Human Rights
	-   Leads to CONFLICT! Can be authorities, violent, etc.
	-   With conflict comes CHANGE in social relations.

--- 

Criminal Behavior:

: Social deviance that involves the breaking of **formal** laws and regulations.

: For example, stealing or robbery, drug use and distribution, and vandalism are all considered criminal actions and involve the breaking of the formal social norms. Taking things that don't belong to you, using and selling drugs, and damaging property that belongs to others are all considered taboo both indirectly and explicitly. **Not all forms of social deviance is criminal**, but many crimes can be categorized as socially deviant. It is very much dependent on the cultural and sociological context.

---

Agents of Socialization:

: Socialization refers to the process by which individuals learn the norms, values, beliefs, and behaviors of their culture or society.

: Agents of socialization are the people, groups and/or the institutions contributing to the socialization process. Agents convey cultural norms, values and behaviors, and include places/people like family, school, peers, media, and religion. This plays an essential role in shaping someone's behaviors, allowing for a place to be found within one's society.
