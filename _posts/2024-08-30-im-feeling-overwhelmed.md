üíô **You're doing incredible**, recognizing that the situation you are in is a crisis is a huge step towards getting support.

**These next steps are important:**

1. Find a safe environment from which you can communicate in a safe and uninterrupted manner. 
    1. If you‚Äôre at school, go to the consolers office and tell them ‚ÄúI am having a mental health crisis and I need to make a phone call.‚Äù
    2. If you‚Äôre at home, lock yourself in the restroom. 
    3. If you‚Äôre in public, find a private area behind some buildings, or ask to be left alone in the car.
2. Call or text one of these hotlines. They are here to help no matter what, and are trained to support  you in a crisis such as this.

Hi. 

Take a second to be mindful of your breathing‚Ä¶ Take a few slow, deep breaths so you can bring your mind back down to earth.

You‚Äôre doing amazing <3

You are safe, you are welcome where you are and who you are in this very moment is exactly who you're supposed to be.

Your body lives in the present, and your mind wants to skip over what‚Äôs before you and look to the past and future. We‚Äôre going to help it recenter by practicing some ***grounding techniques***:

### **Lets focus on sight, first‚Ä¶**

I want you to take a moment at notice what‚Äôs around you. 

Try and look for five different things you can see. 

Notice the shape of your fingernails, the color of the nearest object and the texture of your clothes‚Ä¶ Acknowledge, and take mental note of what you‚Äôre seeing.

### Now onto touch‚Ä¶

Spend a moment touching and feeling what‚Äôs around you and on you. Try and find four things that you can mentally note the √†texture of.

Notice the sensation of gravity itself is pulling gently on you, bringing you closer to earth, or how your shirt feels on your torso.

### What do you hear‚Ä¶?

Take mental note of three things you can hear, like distant traffic, voices the next room over, and the space between each of these sounds. Just listen.

### How does it smell‚Ä¶?

The subtle scent of the air, or a the whafts of a distant fragrance. Try to smell two things which you can make mental note of.

### And what do you taste‚Ä¶?

The lingering suggestion of lunch on your tongue, maybe?

### A Chart to Help You Use the 54321 Method‚Ä¶

| 5 | **Focus On 5 Things You Can See** | Notice the size, shape, and color of things you see. Mentally, take note of each one and how it relates to the rest of the environment. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | **Focus On 4 Things You Can Touch** | Focus on things that feel comforting, such as the top of your legs, your ring, your water bottle, or your pen. Notice what you feel when you touch the four things. Notice the texture ‚Äì Is it soft? Rough? Flexible or hard? Heavy or light? |
| 3 | **Focus On 3 Things You Can Hear** | Notice which sounds may be too loud and consider lowering them if it is within your control, such as the volume of the TV. Lastly, notice which sounds are rhythmic or abrupt; which do you prefer to pay attention to? |
| 2 | **Focus On 2 Things You Can Smell** | Notice if there are any other smells, such as someone‚Äôs cooking that you may not have observed prior. You may want to put on your favorite lotion or use hand sanitizer‚Ä¶ you may also choose to spritz your perfume or use an essential oil. |
| 1 | **Focus On 1 Thing You Can Taste** | If you don‚Äôt have anything nearby to create a noticeable taste, you can still be mindful of what the inside of your mouth tastes. |

Take time and notice how you‚Äôre feeling after having gone through these. 

No matter how far your mind wanders, the present moment is always here, waiting for you to return.

### **Where is your stress on your body?**

Wherever you‚Äôre feeling it, I want you to gently touch that part of your body and comfort it.

Your stressors need comforting too, and it's kind to tend to them‚Ä¶ Sometimes our stress jitters around and causes all kinds of tension inside.

By petting it, brushing it or pressing on it, you're giving it the attention it needs so that it can relax.
